# Pattern Thief

! WIP !

This is fork from [Copper Thief KiCad plugin](https://github.com/mrussell42/copper_thief), and you can check basic usage instructions in origin repo.

I got an idea of copper thieving not only as practical application, but also for aestetic purposes. So my plan is expanding functionality of copper thief not only for thieving dots on a copper layer of PCB, but also thieving of some graphics. For example it would be cool to see a PCB with kumiko pattern instead of just GND zone on keyboard PCB. Why not? It has potential (i guess :smirk_cat: )

Thanks [mrussell42](https://github.com/mrussell42) for this plugin.
